# mean-weather-api
App presents the user with 6 different views (using the router-outlet). Each view presents the user with the current weather information for that city. 
NOTE: In each cities' "component.ts" file, append a private API key to the current URL (can be retrieved from openweathermap.org) in order for the API call to work.
